# Project2

Process is as follows
1) Main - user input 
2) Infix_Eval - Takes an infix string and makes it a post fix string
3) PostFix_Evaluator - Takes a postfix string and gives a result
4) Syntax_Error - Takes any exceptions

Issues 
1) I think our current algorithm is a bit complex. 
2) Loggin is currently to console. A log file would be better, but I ran into erros when trying to share it between classes

Questions
1) Error catching - would it be better to check the entire string first or catch most errors as we process the string in infix?
2) Algorithm - Should I try to merge infix and postfix classes?
3) Logging - Is there a simple way that we could create a universal log file for all of the classes to write output to??

# Project2

Done
1) Added logging to a file log.txt
2) Added try, catch that will prompt the user for a new input
3) Added char or symbol info to exceptions
4) Added exceptions to infix in all switches and top/pop

To Do
Error Codes - Add a unique code to every type of exception thrown
index number_file name abreviation_extension
Example - 01_ie_cp = first error message in the infix_eval cpp

Errors
1) 4++ is seen as invalid by input inspect
2) 2+2^2*3 throws error
3) Divide by zero not caught (fixed by exception in infix_eval, needs to be caught in input inspect first)

# Project2

Done
1) Professor said postfix not needed
2) 1+3 > 2 works now according to the project spec (thanks Chen for catching the error)

Errors
1) 2*-3 throws error in input inspect, (treats negative as subtraction) but it will work in infix_eval if allowed through
2) 1>(3-2)&&2 fails in input inspect
